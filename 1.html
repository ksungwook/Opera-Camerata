<h2>1. L'enfant Prodigue</h2>

<p><strong><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27enfant_prodigue" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">L'enfant prodigue</a></u></strong>  (The Prodigal Son) is a scene lyrique or cantata in one act by Claude Debussy with a text by Edouard Guinand.
The cantata premiered in Paris on June 27, 1884 as part of the Prix de Rome for composition competition which was awarded to Debussy with this piece by 22 out of 28 votes. The prize win garnered Debussy a scholarship to the Académie des Beaux-Arts, which included a four-year residence at the Villa Medici, the French Academy in Rome, to further his studies (1885-1887).

The later version of 1907 was orchestrated with the help of André Caplet and the premiere of this version took place at the Sheffield Music Festival, conducted by Henry Wood.

Although the work was never intended to be staged, it has on occasion been presented as a one-act opera.</p>
